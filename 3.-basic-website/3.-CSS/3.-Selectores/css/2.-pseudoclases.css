/*Logical
  :is -> groups several selectors and takes the highest specificity among the selectors it contains
  :where -> groups several selectors and takes the lowest specificity among the selectors it contains
  :has -> selects a parent element if it contains a child that matches the selectors specified within :has().
  :not() -> selects an element not matching the selectors specified within :not

How to apply CSS rules?
  -When two or more selectors match the same element, the selector with the higher specificity is applied. 
  -If two selectors have the same specificity, the last one in the code is applied.

What is specifity?
  It determines which style rules apply to an element when there are multiple matching selectors.
  
  The specificity of a CSS selector is calculated by adding up the number of each type of selector it contains, with the following priorities:
  Specifity (a,b,c,d) 
    a-> number of #ids in selector
    b-> number of .class, [attribute] of :pseudoclass
    c-> number of element of ::pseudoelement
    d-> number of universal selectors
*/


/*
Instead of 
  #parrafos .normal, 
  #parrafos .especial
  #parrafos p{

we could write the following: */
#is :is(.normal, .especial, p){
  background-color: aquamarine;
}
/*
specificity: 
  #parrafos .normal: 1,1,0
  #parrafos .especial: 1,1,0
  #parrafos p: 1,0,1

"is" has no specifity. It just takes the maximum among its selectors (0,1,0) and then it just adds to the specifity of the selector before "is" (1,0,0) resulting in (1,1,0)

Which is the difference?: Specifity (and elegance)
  First case: (1,1,0), (1,1,0) and (1,0,1).
  Second case: (1,1,0) at any case
*/

/*where groups rules as :is, but its specifity is always zero*/
#where :where(.normal, .especial, p){
  background-color: aquamarine;
}
/*
Therefore, the specifity of the whole rule is (1,0,0) due to #parrafos
